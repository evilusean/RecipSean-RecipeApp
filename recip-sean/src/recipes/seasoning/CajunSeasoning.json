    "notes": "This Cajun Seasoning is a flavorful, keto-friendly spice blend that adds a spicy kick to your dishes without adding carbs. It's perfect for seasoning meats, seafood, vegetables, and other keto-friendly foods, bringing the bold flavors of Cajun cuisine to your ketogenic diet. The blend of herbs and spices provides a complex flavor profile that's spicy, aromatic, and slightly earthy. This seasoning is ideal for those following a ketogenic diet as it contains no added sugars or carbs. For the best results, use fresh, high-quality spices. This seasoning mix can be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to 3 months. To use, simply sprinkle over your food before or during cooking. The cayenne pepper adds heat to this blend, so adjust the amount used based on your spice preference. You can customize this blend by adjusting the ratios of spices to suit your taste. Remember that while this blend doesn't contain salt, many Cajun dishes are traditionally salty, so you may want to add salt separately when cooking."
