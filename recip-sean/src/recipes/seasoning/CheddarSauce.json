    "notes": "Nancy's Cheddar Cheese Sauce is a rich, creamy, and keto-friendly sauce that's perfect for drizzling over vegetables, meat, or using as a dip. It's high in fat and very low in carbs, making it an excellent addition to a ketogenic diet. The combination of heavy cream, cream cheese, and cheddar cheese creates a smooth and flavorful sauce, while the dry mustard adds a subtle tang. For the best keto results, use full-fat cream cheese and a good quality cheddar cheese. This sauce is best served immediately while warm and creamy. If you need to reheat it, do so gently over low heat, stirring constantly to prevent separation. You can customize this sauce by using different types of cheese or adding spices like paprika or garlic powder. Remember that while this sauce is keto-friendly, it is high in calories, so use it in moderation. This versatile sauce can be used as a base for keto-friendly mac and cheese, as a topping for broccoli or cauliflower, or as a dipping sauce for keto-friendly vegetables or pork rinds."
