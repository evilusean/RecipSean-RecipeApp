# RecipSean-RecipeApp
https://recip-sean-recipe-app.vercel.app/
Start: 27September2024</br>
End: 01October2024</br>
A repo for building a recipe app that takes the food you have and tells you what you can cook - or what you need to buy</br>
Going to use React, TS, TailwindCSS, ShadCN, NextJS, Store recipes as JSON objects in this repo, create an ingredients list, maybe responsive?(future sean problem) and I want to try out ShadCN components - after built host on Vercel</br>
Eventually want to get to a point where I can store my grocery list locally and have recipes pulled, whenever I buy more groceries, update local list, and then update available meals, eventually I would want a percent counter so if I'm just missing paprika or whatever it'll give me a status bar with like 95% or something and have highlighted the missing components, search feature, I also eventually want to be able to have a staples list so if I use up milk/eggs/cheese/rice/whatever it will automatically tell me to buy(Tuna, and rice, for 4 months-never 4give 4get, F=-F)</br>
Have dual language support, so I can learn languages as I cook - Japanese recipes in Japanese and English, Czech/Slovak recipes in Slovak and English, flip the card if I need to review. </br>
Recipe Search feature - return react objects </br>
Favorites feature </br>
Japanese/Slovak/Indian/Slowcooker/Low carbs/ collections </br>
MongoDB? Vs Github JSON objects - realistically how many recipes do we need? >500? does it really need to be scalable? Can set up mongoDB for future seans problem if we are still using it in a few years. </br>
Figma - figure out layout - use figma AI to help build first draft - need to learn design anyways - this is a good first project </br>
Do I want to use it on mobile? Should I plan for it to be responsive? do I really want to use up tabletop space for a laptop while cooking to run a react app while cooking? sounds like a disaster waiting to happen </br>
