# RecipSean-RecipeApp
Start: 17July2024</br>
A repo for building a recipe app that takes the food you have and tells you what you can cook - or what you need to buy</br>
Going to use React, TS, TailwindCSS, ShadCN, Store recipes as JSON objects in this repo, create an ingredients list, maybe responsive?(future sean problem) and I want to try out ShadCN components - after built host on Vercel</br>
Eventually want to get to a point where I can store my grocery list locally and have recipes pulled, whenever I buy more groceries, update local list, and then update available meals, eventually I would want a percent counter so if I'm just missing paprika or whatever it'll give me a status bar with like 95% or something and have highlighted the missing components, search feature, I also eventually want to be able to have a staples list so if I use up milk/eggs/cheese/rice/whatever it will automatically tell me to buy(Tuna, and rice, for 4 months-never forget, F=-F)</br>
