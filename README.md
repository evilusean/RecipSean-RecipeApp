# RecipSean-RecipeApp
A repo for building a recipe app that takes the food you have and tells you what you can cook - or what you need to buy
Going to use React, TS, TailwindCSS, ShadCN, Store recipes as JSON objects in this repo, create an ingredients list, maybe responsive?(future sean problem) and I want to try out ShadCN components - after built host on Vercel
