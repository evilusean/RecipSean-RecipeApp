I want the app to search current ingredients and give me what I can make on that, 90% of the time it will be tuna and rice, sometimes not even tuna. F=-F step 1) Escape.
I basically just want a way to save any future recipes and search by main ingredients.

Recipe List(find each individual one, format it correctly, or find another API. JSON vs CSV? Local DB vs MongoDB? many deciSeans - Future sean problems
Pemican 
Amish egg noodles(4 ingredients)
Egg recipes (she will eat zee bugz, produce many eggz, I will be happy)
Slow cooker recipes(chili/stews/soups)
Shepherds Pie
Potatoe Recipes (staple)
Breads(wheat)
Health(carb/sugar/processed substitutes -  do you really need that thing with 400grams of sugar compacted into it?)
Basically anything you can grow cottagecore/homestead once you escape the herd and retire on the top of the mountain to hermitmode - Rip uncle Ted 
sauces(saucier? - Tomatoe sauce=1 ingredient(remove skins+seeds-Nightshade poison)
FermentASean(sauerkraut/kimchi/etc)
Pickled Foods (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pickled_foods)
Apples/Whatever local fruit grows in area recipes(pies, sauces, maple syrup, etc)
Teas/holistic treatments (Pine tea/Chaga/Mushroom PropaGaSean? Foraged vs Sterile environment/Lions Mane/ etc)

Tuna and Rice(a daily staple, for years. tuna and rice a la sean(the secret ingredient=you add chickpeas) - at what point does deprivASean become abuse?
Haitian - (mud pies, cats, dogs, soylent green, '"the other other white meat"' barbeque, Lol, Lmao, etc) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpjvNw88jns&ab_channel=PetTasticsTV

Trying to build this with V0 + Claude + Cursor - I only get a limited amount of credits per day as a F2P -
I can build it page by page, brick by brick, each day adding a bit, then hooking it up on the backend and fixing the code/UI
The AI can do the heavy lifting, I just need to DrAIve it, to build and fix what I need, use my limited tokens each day
If I can figure out how to do the prompts - I can build faster and get crazy good workflows - and finally get paid - Step 1) Escape
Since it can't see my project or codebase - you need to remind it what tech you are using - it keeps giving me '.js' instead of '.ts'
so I will need to craft my proompt each day to build the UI for this app - remind it that I'm using TS/Tailwind/ShadCN etc :
I'm building a recipe app using TS/Tailwind/and ShadCN components - I want it to..... <future sean problem>

I figured out a good way to visually show how it all works - instead of figma - going to try playing around with obsidian - will be able to show how each part connects with eachother and the prompts I used to build that component to save future sean some time - 
system design diagram - I can also make sure the schema is set up for the DB - and see how it interacts - Do I need graphQL? MongoDB? SQL? Do I even need a DB? How does the schema look like? how is the nextJS app going to read it, multiple languages? - how do they interact? etc - still have alot of planning to do - better done in obsidian
